# tree-sitter-func

Originally taken from [this repo](https://github.com/akifoq/tree-sitter-func)
and slightly modified to cover all FunC grammar.

To build grammar (generate C++ parser sources) from command-line, just

```shell
tree-sitter generate
```

To build WASM artifact, launch in project directory:

```shell
yarn grammar:wasm
```
